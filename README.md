This project is about how to use webpack.

In this we will learn about how to install webpack and webpack dev server.

You can read about webpack and webpack-dev-server online.

Webpack is basically  used for bundling the code, and webpack will organize all you code.
Here, in this projrct we are running webpack in 2 mode, i.e development and production mode.

with -p parameter it will run in production mode.


You need to specify the entry and output for the webpack. 
For this project entry is ./src/app.js  and output  is ./dist/bundle.js

We will also loaders and plugins for this basic project.

You can learn all about plugins and loaders online.

I have included a webpack.config.js to configure the webpack.


To start the project  do a npm install.

For running a build in development mode -
    npm run build 

For running a build in production mode -  
    npm run build:prod
